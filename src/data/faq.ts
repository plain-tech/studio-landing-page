    question: "How does the credit system work?",
    answer:
      "Each design generation costs 1 credit with the standard model, or 3 credits with the Pro model for higher quality results. Unused credits never expire as long as your subscription is active. You can see your credit balance anytime in the app.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between standard and Pro generations?",
    answer:
      "Pro generations use our most advanced AI model, producing higher quality, more detailed results with better understanding of complex design requests. Standard generations are faster and perfect for quick iterations and concept exploration.",
  },
  {

    question: "Do I need design experience to use the tool?",
    answer:
      'Not at all! Simply upload a photo of any room and describe what you want in plain English. Say things like "make it more modern" or "add a blue velvet sofa" - our AI understands natural language.',
  },
  {
    question: "Is this web-based or do I need to install software?",
    answer:
      "Completely web-based. No downloads or installations required - just open your browser and start designing. Your projects are saved in the cloud and accessible from any device.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the generated images commercially?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All images you generate are yours to use for commercial purposes, including client presentations, marketing materials, and social media. Pro and Team plans include full commercial licensing.",
